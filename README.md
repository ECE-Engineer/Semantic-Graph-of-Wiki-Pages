# Semantic-Graph-of-Wiki-Pages
Create a program to collect at least 500 Wikipedia pages and links from these pages to other Wikipedia pages. Collect similarity data for each page using word frequencies and/or word2vec. Report the number of spanning trees (for any arbitrary node as initial starting point) as a connectivity check. Utilize caching to avoid unnecessary reconstruction.
